# Portfolio

This is my portfolio featuring my tech experience, resume, and projects I currently have hosted using Netlify and Firebase. This is a react app project created using Vite and a responsive web app that can be viewed in web and mobile devices.

1. The styling was created using Bootstrap and CSS.
2. React components are used throughout the project with minor onHover effects.
3. Hoverable color changing links are used and can be clicked to display a selected link in a new tab.
4. JSON objects are being used as a database to hold the experience and projects data.

## How to use the Project
