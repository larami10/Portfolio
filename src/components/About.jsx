      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        Back in 2006, I would watch my older brother work on his high school
        programming projects. Although he may not have known it at the time, I
        would watch him struggle with his projects and later on feel his
        excitement when he'd have that Aha! moment when solving his problems.
        He's my inspiration for my programming journey that began with Java in
        2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        Little did I know that I would inherit my brother's passion and come to
        receive my Bachelor's of Science from Arizona State University in 2022.
        My ASU experience was amazing and I learned more than I could imagine
        from programming languages (C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and improving my
        Java skills) to Software Development diagrams, processes, and project
        management. My main focus these days is continuing to grow my knowledge
        and experience by working with web and mobile frameworks and libraries
        (.NET, Flutter, GatsbyJS, ReactJS).
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually exploring new places and
        restaurants with my wife, watching anime with One Piece being my all
        time favorite (prior to the Netflix live action), or running around
        Hyrule in Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
